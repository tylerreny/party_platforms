# Party Platforms

This file contains a CSV file of major party platforms from the 1840 to 2016 that I scraped from the [UCSB Presidency Project Website](http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/2016_election.php) and the python code I used to collect the data. There are no promises that the data is completely accurate, so be sure to check it against the database if you use it.
